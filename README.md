I developed a rhythm-based music game in C++ using the Raylib graphics library, inspired by popular musical arcade games. The game generates beats at intervals tied to a user-defined BPM, which descend toward designated target areas. Players must hit matching keys in time to remove beats and maintain a streak score. I designed interactive color-coded sections, implemented real-time collision detection, and integrated streamed music playback.
